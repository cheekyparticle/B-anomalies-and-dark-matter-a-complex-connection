See arXiv:1902.01789 for details. This repo has the data required to reproduce Figures 6, 7 and 8.

The four data files named "majorana_gmu2(4)_summary_x1(4).dat" contain all the relevant information from the scan of the parameter space of the model, and were used to do Figure 6. In particular, every file contains the following information, which is also summarised in the first line of the file:

   1) m_DM: mass of the dark matter (DM) particle
   2) m_phiq: mass of the coloured scalar new particle
   3) m_phil: mass of the leptonic scalar new particle
   4) gmu: new physics coupling of the leptonic scalar to the DM and leptons
   5) |gq|_max and |gq|_min: maximum and minimum allowed values for the module of the new physics couplings of the coloured scalar to the DM and the quark 'q', with q = u, c, t, s, b (note that gd = 0)


The files "DD_Response.dat" hold the responses from Xenon1T experiment (2018), and were used to do Figures 7 and 8. In particular, every file contains the following information, which is also summarised in the first line of the file:

   1) Anapole: anapole response
   2) C1 and C4: c1 and c4 response
   4) Total: total response

Neutrino Floor data can be found in directory "Neutrino_floors". 
"Floor_Op1.dat" is the neutrino floor for a Xenon target for Operator 1 NREFT interactions. The format is 

[DM_MASS] [Coefficient_1] 

"Floor_anapole.dat" is the neutrino floor for a Xenon target for anapole interactions. The format is

[DM_MASS] [A as difined in Eq.(4.3)]

===============================================================================================================================
Exclusion limits can be found in directory "Direct_Detection_Exclusions". The experiment that the file refers to is in the name. Column 1 in all in the mass, Column 2 is either the C1 coefficient in the NREFT or the anapole (A) response depending on the file.
