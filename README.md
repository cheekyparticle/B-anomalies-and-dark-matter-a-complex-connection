See arXiv:1902.01789 for details. This repo has the data required to reproduce Figure 7 and 8.

===============================================================================================================================
Neutrino Floor data can be found in directory "Neutrino_floors". 
"Floor_Op1.dat" is the neutrino floor for a Xenon target for Operator 1 NREFT interactions. The format is 

[DM_MASS] [Coefficient_1] 

"Floor_anapole.dat" is the neutrino floor for a Xenon target for anapole interactions. The format is

[DM_MASS] [A as difined in Eq.(4.3)]

===============================================================================================================================
Exclusion limits can be found in directory "Direct_Detection_Exclusions". The experiment that the file refers to is in the name. Column 1 in all in the mass, Column 2 is either the C1 coefficient in the NREFT or the anapole (A) response depending on the file. 

===============================================================================================================================
Model_Parameters have both the parameter points in the files named "majorana*.dat" with a header describing what the columns stand for. The files "DD_Response.dat" hold the responses from Xenon1T experiment (2018).
